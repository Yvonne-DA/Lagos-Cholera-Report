### Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the cholera outbreak in some Local Government Areas in Lagos state for the month of April and June. By analyzing various aspects of the cholera data, we seek to identify trends make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the infection.

### Data source
Lagos cholera data: the primary dataset used for this analysis is the cholera case data excel file, containing detailed information about the outbreak of the infection in some LGA in Lagos state.

### Tool used
Excel was used for data cleaning, analysis and visualization

### Data cleaning/preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
1.	Data loading and inspection
2.	Handling missing values
3.	Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory data analysis
Pivot tables were used to explore the dataset and to answer key questions such as;
- Top 3 LGA with the highest confirmed cases
- Top 5 suspected cases by LGA
- Top 3 death toll by LGA
- Monthly cholera trend

### Analysis
- Replaced empty cells with the minimum values on column I =Min(I2:I21)
- Derived the weekday and month using the ‘Text function’
=Text(F2 “dddd”)
=Text(F2 “mmmm”)

### Visualization

### Result and findings
 The analysis results are summerized as follows:
 1. Eti-osa has the highest suspected case
 2. Eti-osa has the highest confirmed cases
 3. lagos island has the highest death toll

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions;
- Weekly sanitation should be organized particulary in Eti-osa LGA by the local government head also, enusre all houses in the area have access to clean water
- Everyone should be mandated to carry out proper hygiene at all times. e.g washing hands often with soap and safe water, proper washing of fruits before eating, cleaning food preparation areas and cookwares with soap and water after each use.
